# K.-Hartman-Portfolio

DESCRIPTION: 

    I recently updated this code to showcase an updated portfolio. While doing this, I utilized the CSS framework, Bootstrap. JavaScript was also incorporated to apply functionality. 

    Issues that I ran into while updating this were BootStrap blocking specific styling features I wanted to add, JavaScript fucntions not working as I desired.
